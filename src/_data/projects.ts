Simple but worthwhile questions about the afterlife are written on the wall, and graphic images that form a kind of corresponding answer are visualized and appear on the flags.", "One of the reasons the subject of the afterlife is of historical and contemporary interest is because our values surrounding people, things, and events in the present relate to the future, including possibilities for individuals' existence after death. If we know that it is impossible for individuals to survive biological death, speculation about an afterlife we might expect or hope for would be meaningless. But it would not be pointless to consider whether or not the impossibility of the afterlife affects our values in this life. What is the meaning of our lives now if we take seriously the idea that we will be annihilated when we die? Or, conversely, if we know that there is a possibility or even a likelihood that we may survive death, why is it important and how will it affect our lives today?" ]
